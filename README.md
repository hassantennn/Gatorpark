# Gatorpark

This repository contains the Gatorpark iOS application. To run the app locally you will need to provide a Firebase configuration file.

## Firebase configuration

1. Copy `Gatorpark/GoogleService-Info.plist.example` to `Gatorpark/GoogleService-Info.plist`.
2. Replace each placeholder value with the credentials for your Firebase project.

The real configuration file is intentionally ignored by Git to keep secrets out of version control.

## Development notes

Common Xcode build artifacts and local dependency directories are ignored via `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean.
